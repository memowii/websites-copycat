            <h2 class="h4 font-weight-bolder my-4">Choosing which responsive design strategy is best for your project is
                crucial</h2>
            <p><img src="assets/images/AdobeStock_133739320-300x210.jpeg"
                    alt="Research Information Graph Search Concept"
                    class="mb-3">
                Deciding between mobile and desktop responsive strategies is an important step in any internet based
                project. But it doesn’t have to be difficult. Avoiding design mistakes from the start can save a ton of
                time and money in the long run. If you know what factors to assess when weighing your options, you can
                move forward with your project with confidence.</p>
            <p>There are two dominant responsive strategies for approaching a web project with multiple platforms in
                mind. These two design strategies are desktop-first and the mobile-first. After you’ve completed a few
                web projects for similar audiences, you may tend to make one or the other your default strategy.
                However, it’s best to consider the numerous technical and business aspects of the project before
                deciding which strategy is the most appropriate.</p>
            <h2 class="h2 font-weight-bolder my-4">The Two Approaches</h2>
            <p>Having been the only choice for a long time, ‘desktop-first’ has been the traditional approach to
                designing websites. Even after the rise of mobile devices, there are plenty of situations in which this
                ‘think big’ method remains ideal. Yet, other times this approach can cost a fortune. Let’s look at how
                to choose between multi-platform design strategies and why the wrong choice may create a financial
                disaster.</p>
            <h2 class="h2 font-weight-bolder my-4">Desktop-First Responsive Design</h2>
            <p>
                <img src="assets/images/AdobeStock_87755771-300x200.jpeg"
                     alt="Laptop computer over New York city skyline. "
                     class="mb-3">
                Designing for full sized screens means building for the highest specs to display and communicate as much
                as possible. In this design type it’s not the mobile but the desktop experience that needs to be
                detailed and dynamic.
            </p>
            <p>Going down to smaller resolutions (often called graceful degradation) means hiding and wrapping elements
                while trying to support as many original features as possible. In this case, the mobile experience is
                functional rather than refined. </p>
            <p>A strong desktop design is ideal for feature-rich websites and interfaces targeting desktop users
                (usually office based), especially if there is a separate Android or iOS app for the core features which
                would serve to optimize the experience for mobile users.</p>
            <h2 class="h2 font-weight-bolder my-4">When Desktop-First Is The Most Appropriate:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Desktop hits</strong>: are more than 80% of your traffic or hits from desktop are at 50%,
                    but your sales are significantly higher on desktop
                </li>
                <li><strong>Site interface</strong>: is feature-rich
                </li>
                <li><strong>Supplemental support</strong> for core functions: dedicated Android or iOS app for mobile
                    users
                </li>
                <li><strong>Creative design</strong>: You focus on complex and enhanced visuals as part of the marketing
                    strategy
                </li>
                <li><strong>Product type</strong>: Your product is intended for use on a desktop, such as a productivity
                    tool or business related service
                </li>
                <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> You need a highly refined desktop and simple mobile option
                </li>
                <li><strong>Resources:</strong>Your time and budget are limited, yet changes are needed on the existing
                    product
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="h2 font-weight-bolder my-4">Mobile-First Responsive Design</h2>
            <p>
                <img src="assets/images/AdobeStock_74852199-300x204.jpeg"
                     alt="render of a collection of smartphones and tablets with different screens"
                     class="mb-3">
                Mobile first is designed mainly for functionality. It’s a very focused approach starting with putting
                out a core function and layering the extras incrementally for higher resolutions (often called
                progressive enhancement). The mobile-first strategy is often referred to as a content-first strategy
                because your website’s content must be carefully researched and structured to be categorized based on
                importance. This method can be much more expensive due to the more extended preparation phase and the
                expertise needed to create the platform’s versatility.
            </p>
            <h2 class="h2 font-weight-bolder my-4">When Mobile-First Is The Most Appropriate:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mobile hits</strong> are 80% or more of your traffic or 50%, but the sales are significantly
                    higher on mobile
                </li>
                <li><strong>Features</strong>: A handful of core features and/or several well-defined selling features
                </li>
                <li><strong>Product type</strong>: Entertainment, lifestyle, networking, news or another on-the-go
                    category
                </li>
                <li><strong>Design</strong>: Simple and minimalistic
                </li>
                <li><strong>User Experience</strong>: Optimized mobile; modest desktop
                </li>
                <li><strong>Resources</strong>: Time and money to build a future-proof base from scratch
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="h2 font-weight-bolder my-4">Changing Your Current Strategy</h2>
            <p>It’s best to thoroughly assess your best strategy before beginning any development. However, it’s better
                to make the choice late than never. Things happen, maybe your product is being used in a new way, you’re
                introducing new features, or your analytics have changed over time. When it’s clear that a shift is
                needed it may be best to make the change than to continue a strategy that isn’t working.</p>
            <h2 class="h2 font-weight-bolder my-4">Optimizing For Mobile After A Desktop-First Strategy</h2>
            <p>

                     class="mb-3">
                Generally speaking, degradation from a desktop version to a mobile version inevitably creates setbacks
                in the user experience. Some desktop technology is simply not supported on mobile devices and needs to
                be substituted with a fallback solution that will likely be challenging and costly to implement.
            </p>
            <h2 class="h2 font-weight-bolder my-4">This change may include adding:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Mobile-intuitive user flow
                </li>
                <li>Support for touch &amp; swipe, scroll, and zoom gestures (as well as multi-touch/multi-finger
                    interactions)
                </li>
                <li>Mobile browser support for advanced style and html elements (preparing with fallbacks and polyfills)
                </li>
                <li>General mobile best practices (eliminate hover state, box shadows, opacity, iframes, vertical
                    layout; minimize padding, DOM manipulation, network requests)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="h2 font-weight-bolder my-4">Optimizing For Desktop After A Mobile-First Strategy</h2>
            <p>Technical modifications are rarely required in this case, so it’s a less costly mistake. What often
                happens, however, is that large screen areas remain unused and functions are left unexpanded, lacking a
                title or visual guide even where there would be enough space to apply them. Sometimes the design is not
                prepared for a more creative visual, and the brand needs to be expanded.</p>

            <p>Overall, it’s important to make the choice of what’s best for your business after thoroughly assessing
                the pros and cons of each method. Even if you have to change your current plan, using the strategy that
                best suits your company will pay off in the end.</p>
